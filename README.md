# Amalgamation
An amalgamation of various social media applications

Feel free to mess around with this repo by cloning it. Once cloned you'll need to add a `.env` file. Add the following to the `.env` file
```
TEST_DB_NAME=
PROD_DB_NAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_USER=
SECRET_KEY=
PUBLIC_URL=
```

You'll need to create a database using [MongoDB](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) and assign the keys their appropriate values. The `SECRET_KEY` is used for JWT generation, give it a value, the harder it is to guess, the better! The key `PUBLIC_URL` is only for production.
Open a terminal and split it. In one terminal `CD` into `client` and run `npm start`, this will automatically open a window in your browser. In the other run terminal run `npm run dev`, this will start up your api server. You are now running the application locally.

It is ready to deploy using heroku by running `heroku login` this will redirect you to the heroku login screen. Once logged in run `heroku create name-of-application`. Open heroku in the browser and go to settings, you'll need to add *Config Variables* to the application as you have done for running it locally.

Chitter Challenge
=================

* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
-------

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

Technical Approach:
-----

In this unit, you integrated a database into Bookmark Manager using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries. You can continue to use this approach when building Chitter Challenge.

If you'd like more technical challenge now, try using an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) as the database interface.

Some useful resources:
**Ruby Object Mapper**
- [ROM](https://rom-rb.org/)

**ActiveRecord**
- [ActiveRecord ORM](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
- [Sinatra & ActiveRecord setup](https://learn.co/lessons/sinatra-activerecord-setup)

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the CSS to make it look good.

Good luck and let the chitter begin!
